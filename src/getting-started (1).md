# Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `script/bootstrap`
3. Make your changes -- don't forget to add unit test coverage!
4. Run `script/cibuild` to make sure your tests pass and that you have 100% test coverage.
5. If you've added or changed major functionality, update or create [acceptance tests](/spec/acceptance) to demonstrate it.
6. Run `script/cibuild-entitlements-app-acceptance` to make sure the acceptance tests pass.
